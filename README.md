Hello, Iâ€™m Daniel, you may call me Dani.
-
I'm a Spanish Cybersecurity and Hacking student at MSMK University in Spain.
-
My hobbies include videogames, as well as coding when I find something I want to code/help coding within my achievement range.
-
I will collaborate on whatever I can and/or want to help on, so feel free to reach out to me and ask in detail. Emphasis on detail.
-
You may reach me through mail at dani.gomez.llusa@gmail.com, though don't expect me to answer immediately, as I don't have that much free time.
An alternative way of reaching me would be Discord (Danielaco23#9761).
